<seg id="7">Henry has been forced to undergo painful childhood memories.</seg>
<seg id="8">He has been in therapy on several occasions after the death of his mother, and he is considering a lot of relationship with their father.</seg>
<seg id="9">Father was very difficult to read.</seg>
<seg id="10">His face is never seen, only voice said: back off the noise.</seg>
<seg id="11">I leave it in peace.</seg>
<seg id="12">The next item!</seg>
<seg id="13">I think now cricket.</seg>
<seg id="14">parents, your brothers, and Hilton, which had already grown up when I was a child, I went to a pub and discussed, for instance, a pint of beer or cricket form of beauty.</seg>
<seg id="15">I never spoke to him on those issues.</seg>
<seg id="16">Many of my life he had this smile on the man in the corner, reading the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="17">Henry opened recently in metal melting from Du d and got the idea of what kind of life her father must have been, although working conditions today are better than they were.</seg>
<seg id="18">Sul a rooms today are a little brighter, but in practice they are dark, smoke, using the depth of labyrinth where syöksäh in flames, smoke and soot that are reminiscent of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="19">Father had to go to the village and just for our country, and slowly he began to sing in order to wash the dirt in the melting away of their own accord.</seg>
<seg id="20">Sula to many around the other night, I understood that he had done the work for years to provide us with food on the table, and I started to appreciate him more.</seg>
<seg id="21">In spite of Henry's childhood was missing by the proximity of their parents.</seg>
<seg id="22">Father never hugged me and never said that they love me.</seg>
<seg id="23">It is when my mother began to sick shortly before his death, we started to come out with each other, we love each other.</seg>
<seg id="24">Henry is the daughter of Billie Dawn, with Fresenius, and their children, he has been able to share the love, which he himself had no children.</seg>
<seg id="25">Are you all the time to be saying 'I love you'?</seg>
<seg id="26">Sandoval, now the government h!</seg>

<seg id="29">Why not be friends?</seg>
<seg id="30">She is a great mother</seg>
<seg id="31">Henry is still good friends with Fresenius's, with whom she was married for 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="32">Dawn is a good man.</seg>
<seg id="33">Why not Dawn and I have friends?</seg>
<seg id="34">She is a great mother.</seg>
<seg id="35">Henry's own mother had diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="36">It was also one of the causes that led to the mother's death.</seg>
<seg id="37">When I started to suffer the abundance of obesity and diabetes and symptoms, a doctor they ordered me to do a U-turn.</seg>
<seg id="38">Since then, I have a lot of fitness, and I had to start a diet that was hard to reduce symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="39">It is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="40">and dull.</seg>
<seg id="41">Nobody enjoys eating carrots.</seg>
<seg id="42">Henry's well-known, short beard may reflect a change in his career.</seg>
<seg id="43">And so, having a lot of good feedback from critics to take on the role of a loving he is immersed in the theatre.</seg>
<seg id="44">Next it was the mistake of comedy and August Wilson, Feng CES ("Aida").</seg>
<seg id="45">You make your way offers a different experience than the "commitment" and comedy that Henry has done throughout the busy careers.</seg>
<seg id="46">Henry started with a field of only 16-year-old factory worker.</seg>
<seg id="47">There is a DJ, I noticed he was doing nothing on my support and contacted New CES, the ability to compete.</seg>
<seg id="48">Henry's TV career began in the mid-1970s. 'Mel the TV for a long time I was the only black commentator and comedian,' he says.</seg>
<seg id="49">Henry educational work.</seg>
<seg id="50">I had to grow up in the spotlight, I had to learn to produce jokes from a conveyor belt between 1975 and 1985, while the body out and had the television on, it was difficult.</seg>
<seg id="51">Le New CES - the ability to turn the race in 1975</seg>
<seg id="52">Henry's manager had the rights to The Black and White, Min Show too ’ s life, light entertainment programme, of which appeared as black people we covered, so if Henry came together as the programme for five years.</seg>
<seg id="53">my family did not like that.</seg>
<seg id="54">On the one hand, I would hope that I would never take part at all, but I do not regret it.</seg>
<seg id="55">Although the position was surprising and deplorable, work on a massive events and learn how to deal with the public.</seg>
<seg id="56">While the 'British TV rewarded, for many years the favourite and light entertainment programming at the same time,' 'was a grotesque parody of black people'.</seg>
<seg id="57">Henry worked in the '80s in another comedy series that was fun and that was full of admiration for black British culture.</seg>
<seg id="58">The flights to Henry Show too, the first period was in 1984, and in the 1990s, Henry was known, among other things, that figure actually cook Gary Black, presently the only comedy series Che f!</seg>
<seg id="59">In the next decade, Henry spent advertising, documentaries, TV series and film parts, but the BBC in 2008, will fly to Henry in the TV series, after he said to themselves: 'What are you going next, Le, now it seems that we are just here or go to side-track'.</seg>
<seg id="60">Next it was the turn of Radio 4 documentary series "What Exactly ’ s Great on the occasion of the...? '</seg>
<seg id="61">The first part was Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="62">I have always tried to avoid Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="63">it is not really taught us in school properly, and I think it was a white middle class, which uses a pair of trousers, and money.</seg>
<seg id="64">My subject of Shakespeare-inspired me with fear.</seg>
<seg id="65">All the people we interviewed, Peter Hall, Trevor, Les steel used in the Adriatic, a den, and they said to me: 'Kok in doubt.</seg>
<seg id="66">"I reject the whole idea before you know what I am talking about.</seg>
<seg id="67">The way no words and understand, why do we all love Shakespeare so much.</seg>
<seg id="68">Henry said 20 of the take is to give the final speech of the documentary, and she was sold.</seg>
<seg id="69">I felt that I can do this.</seg>
<seg id="70">Tun was almost as if some of it would have been in the past, and now was put in place.</seg>
<seg id="71">"This is it, this is important, so take it seriously, you learn of it, doing a little background research.</seg>
<seg id="72">training process was tough, and I read the scene for months before it was carried out.</seg>
<seg id="73">It was ultimately a success.</seg>
<seg id="74">That apparently was expected to fail, but that is not quite the case.</seg>
<seg id="75">Pia after Henry played the main role in the comedy.</seg>
<seg id="76">There suddenly was in the British national theatre, and I could not believe it.</seg>
<seg id="77">I point my mind was the idea: 'O' side, you have changed.</seg>
<seg id="78">Kerr will play had technical problems, and Henry knew clearly that it was his job to entertain the public.</seg>
<seg id="79">"My voice I said to me: Your success has to be able to survive alone for 10 minutes, until the computer works again. ’"</seg>
<seg id="80">Instead of the assistant director, announced that the motion will be resumed as soon as the problem has been corrected.</seg>
<seg id="81">I walked out of the scene, and I think that would be a sigh of relief.</seg>
<seg id="82">It's not my duty.</seg>
<seg id="83">I can leave it to others.</seg>
<seg id="84">"When you are a part of the scene, to keep the 'role</seg>
<seg id="85">Henry '' Duchesse Feng CES in-theatre</seg>
<seg id="86">Mountains of CES Feng of learning '' drama was challenging.</seg>

<seg id="88">This, too, this show was well received, so it was like a sign from the gods; 'This is what you should do'.</seg>
<seg id="89">This, of course, Henry says the All U Enterprises A voice.</seg>
<seg id="90">'What I decided to stick to it.</seg>
<seg id="91">I love my sincere thanks to this work.</seg>
<seg id="92">I love training rooms.</seg>
<seg id="93">Henry is still basically a comedian: small humour larvae interrupt the constantly changing what he was in for.</seg>
<seg id="94">Stan d-up limited, whereas abstinence is not the issue, because the immediate gratitude felt by the public seems to be dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="95">If the hunger for it constantly, it can lead to an impasse.</seg>
<seg id="96">This is sometimes a lot of time at the Apollo theatre, it seems, but in general, it is no longer excite me in the same way as before.</seg>
<seg id="97">would ask Henry, will he continue to leave the new stand-up tour.</seg>
<seg id="98">It is a real pleasure to sit together with the director, who is helping to shape the beginning, middle and end, and I do not believe that I never lost that feeling.</seg>
<seg id="99">This, then, is his new re-creation?</seg>
<seg id="100">I believe so.</seg>

<seg id="5">"This was to be expected, but nevertheless it is infuriating, 'says the Democratic Party, legislator Emil y La.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is not what Beijing has promised.</seg>
<seg id="7">Gulls are lying in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is clear that we will work with the autocratic regime.</seg>

<seg id="10">Within the 1997 since Britain handed over Hong Kong to China when Beijing promised residents that they would be able to choose their leader from 2017 onwards.</seg>
<seg id="11">China's leaders, Sunday's decision was a democratic breakthrough, since it will enable Hong Kong to vote in the direct election, but it also makes it clear that China wants to control strictly the nomination through the committee process, which is governed from Beijing.</seg>

<seg id="18">Green in the newsletter published by the organisers said that the business' to ending Cup to Central, staging a last resort, which would be put into action only if there is no hope for dialogue and there is no other way '.</seg>
<seg id="19">We are very sorry when we announce that today, the last chance for dialogue have failed and the centre of power is going to happen.</seg>
<seg id="20">Hong Kong authorities are well prepared for the Beijing announcement for days, and on Sunday, the security measures were strict capital close to government buildings including the police was, alternately, and barricades.</seg>

<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin insisted Sunday that Ukraine's government to put an end to the battles against separatists in the eastern parts of the country and to begin immediate negotiations between the assets' 'of the property, Russian news sources say.</seg>
<seg id="3">His representatives in parliament joined D which clarified later that Putin meant that separatists from the eastern Ukrainian region would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine need to reconsider, in order to give the Russian-speaking population the power to defend their own rights and interests.</seg>
<seg id="4">Putin's government in Kiev's call for negotiations with pro-Russian rebels as equal negotiating partners will respond to his apparent strategy he has followed since the violence began five years ago: he is trying to help the separatists to power in the region and to force the government to grant Ukraine in recently-heralded Novo Barros at Independence, which will enable it to turn to Russia instead of the West.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Kan, 1 TV channel in an interview with Ukraine, Putin condemned the army's attempt to regain control of the separatist eastern Don and Luhan said the region, which separatists stormed Moscow in March and April to Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula itself on 18 March.</seg>
<seg id="6">Kremlin and separatists have recently dipped Novo Barros' and ',' 'a new Russia, this term to remind the Russian power revolutions that preceded the glory days.</seg>
<seg id="7">Russian news agency Baltic ar-Ta Exchange, Putin said that the planned peace negotiations are an illusion '' as long as the politicians are carrying out campaigns on 26 October parliamentary elections, and government troops are attacking the separatists controlled areas against civilians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We need to start the negotiations immediately, not only on technical matters, but also in society and the role of the state in south-eastern Ukraine: It will take into account the interests of the people who live there, 'he says.</seg>
<seg id="9">The almost so, Putin's reference to '' has to do with the nature of the broader autonomy, which has been discussed for months with Kiev's leadership as it tries to make the Russian-speaking regions to dispel fears that their cultural and linguistic rights were under threat.</seg>
<seg id="10">Only the government can grant the eastern territories of the necessary independence, joined parliament says.</seg>
<seg id="11">This issue cannot be talks between Ukraine and Russia, joined parliament says, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but Ukraine's internal conflict".</seg>
<seg id="12">Representative from the Kremlin, which was intended to correct the Putin comments wrong interpretation '' stressed that the Russian administration deals with eastern regions separatist rebel in a different way than the Crimea when it practically invaded the territory whose 2 million population, the majority are ethnic Russians.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moscow would be far more difficult to link themselves to or even Don also said Luhan regions of eastern Ukraine, because the majority of people there to 6.5 million people is ethnic Russian, and because the conflict from the opinion polls show that the majority of the population in favour of remaining in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="14">Independence, which Russian diplomats have discussed international forums, would give local governments the right to establish their own trade agreements and foreign relations, which would give the Kremlin virtually to the area, which connects the Russian Crimea.</seg>

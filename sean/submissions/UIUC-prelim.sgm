<seg id="67">Tapaile words and ymmärrät , why do we all love Shakespeare so much . </seg>
<seg id="68">Henry said the 20 säettä Othellon for a documentary about the last speech , and she had been sold . </seg>
<seg id="69">I knew that I will be able to do that . </seg>
<seg id="70">it seemed almost as if a part of me would have been lacking in the past , and now it was in place . </seg>
<seg id="71">&quot; This is it , this is important , and so will not take it seriously , do our säkeesi , do not do a small taustatutkimusta . </seg>

<seg id="78">again , the play had technical problems , and Henry knew clearly that it was his job to entertain the public . </seg>

<seg id="89">Henry says this of course KUMEALLA voice . </seg>
<seg id="90">so I decided to leave it at that . </seg>
<seg id="91">I love my sincere thanks to this work . </seg>

<seg id="2">Today , it was just a great fiilis . </seg>
<seg id="3">this was said Sakari koripalloilija Pehkonen in 1995 , when Finland was played for the European lopputurnauksessa Maroussin palloiluhallissa against France in Athens . </seg>
<seg id="4">Pehkonen not exaggerated . </seg>
<seg id="5">I remember when the game was there . </seg>
<seg id="6">as they were also some 100 Finnish , who shouted at the 20 , 000 spectators , the acquisition of the otherwise empty halliin fuss . </seg>

<seg id="16">Dettmann now can say that it was from a distance a wise , even though everybody does sujunutkaan according to the script . </seg>
<seg id="17">Athens then koripallomaajoukkue crashed deep . </seg>
<seg id="18">Finns were present at the Athens games , out of a total of a little more than a hundred . </seg>
<seg id="19">that belonged to the reporters , the players &apos; relatives , the Finns koripallovalmentajat and some of the fans . </seg>
<seg id="20">Bilbaossakin are journalists , relatives and the trainers , but there is also the fans . </seg>
<seg id="21">and there are many of them . </seg>
<seg id="22">phenomenon has grown to incomprehensible proportions . </seg>
<seg id="23">no one will be able to tell the exact figure suomalaiskisaturisteista . </seg>
<seg id="24">estimates have been on the move between 7,500 @-@ 10,000 . </seg>
<seg id="25">was the figure anything over there , is it just an incomprehensible number . </seg>

<seg id="37">let me take you back to the year of 1995 . </seg>
<seg id="38">then päävalmentaja Dettmann challenged koripalloliittoa pelaajiakin heittäytymään and of top @-@ class sport in a professional manner . </seg>
<seg id="39">it took almost 10 years to do so . </seg>

<seg id="47">Kori- and lentopallossa played for hundreds , or an average of a little more than a thousand katsojalle . </seg>
<seg id="48">Itkonen considers the question is a good one , and not necessarily the answer , one that promises to give a very good species . </seg>
<seg id="49">the second referred believes interest in moving . </seg>

<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday called for the Ukrainian government to put an end to the fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and to begin immediate negotiations on the outgoing valtiomaisuudesta &apos; &apos; in the region , the Russian uutislähteet will tell . </seg>
<seg id="3">his representative to Dmitry Peskov clarified later that Putin meant that , in the face of the separatists in the eastern Ukrainian region would become part of Russia , but that its status within Ukraine must rethink of the Russian @-@ speaking region , so that we can give people the power to stand up for their own rights and interests . </seg>
<seg id="4">Putin &apos;s Kiev to the government &apos;s call for talks with the rebels as equal venäjämielisten neuvottelukumppaneina is responsible for his apparent strategy , which he has followed since the violence began five years ago : he is trying to help the separatists attempting to take over the area and the Ukrainian government to force it to grant the newly julistetulle Novorossijalle independence in practice , through which it can move with Russia instead of the West . </seg>
<seg id="5">State channel 1 -tv @-@ channel , in an interview with Ukraine , Putin condemned the attempts by the army to retake the separatist @-@ controlled eastern Donetskin and Luhanskin region , which separatists stormed the Moscow annexed in March and April in the Ukrainian Crimea peninsula itself on 18 March . </seg>
<seg id="6">the Kremlin and separatists have recently dipped Novorossijaksi &apos; &apos; in the region , &apos; &apos; into a new Russian empire , this term to remind the Russian revolution to the dimensionality of days . </seg>
<seg id="7">Russian news agency Itar @-@ Tassin , Putin has said that the planned peace negotiations are an illusion &apos; &apos; as long as Ukraine &apos;s politicians are taking on 26 October , the campaigns for the elections and the government troops are attacking the separatist @-@ controlled areas against civilians . </seg>
<seg id="8">&quot; We need to start immediately in the extensive negotiations , not just the technical aspects , but also in society and the role of the state in south @-@ eastern Ukraine , so that takes into account the interests of the people there &quot; , he says . </seg>
<seg id="9">Peskovin valtiomaisuudesta , according to Putin &apos;s reference to &apos; &apos; has to do with greater independence , which has been debated for months in Kiev with the leadership of the Russian @-@ speaking regions when it tries to dispel fears that their cultural and linguistic rights were under threat . </seg>
<seg id="10">Ukraine &apos;s government will be able to provide only the eastern territories of the independence of their needs , Peskov says . </seg>
<seg id="11">on this issue there can be no talks between Ukraine and Russia , Peskov says , &apos; because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine , but Ukraine &apos;s internal conflict &quot; . </seg>
<seg id="12">Kremlin representative interruption , which was intended to correct the wrong interpretation &apos; &apos; of the Putin comments , stressed that the Russian government is dealing with the eastern regions of the separatist rebellion in a different way than in the case of the Crimea , making it virtually occupied the region of 2 million people , of which the majority of the population is ethnically Russian . </seg>
<seg id="13">Moscow would be much more difficult to link itself even Donetskin or Luhanskin regions in eastern Ukraine , because most of the 6.5 million people living in the region is not ethnic Russians , and because the conflict before public opinion polls show that the majority of the population voted in favour of staying on in Ukraine . </seg>
<seg id="14">Independence , which venäläisdiplomaatit are discussed in international forums , would give Ukraine the right of local governments to agree on in our own kauppasopimuksistaan and ulkosuhteistaan , which would give the Kremlin virtually power in the region , which links the Russian Crimea . </seg>

<seg id="18">his independence on their vision , however , seems to be in the Kremlin and Moscow &apos;s signs and perhaps lietsomien separatist sentiment . </seg>
<seg id="19">Putin put forward their demands to the government of the latest negotiations in Kiev venäjämielisten as equal partners with the rebels since the rebels have advanced more in the last week , Russian tanks and troops invasion of eastern Ukraine , a region previously rauhanomaiselta Azovin sea coast . </seg>
<seg id="20">Ukraine &apos;s security authorities fear that the Russian @-@ backed separatist Novoazovskin to take possession of the city is the beginning of a larger effort , which is designed to take over the whole of the strategically important coastal region Crimea until now . </seg>

<seg id="22">Poroshenko was speaking on Saturday in Brussels , the European Union &apos;s leaders begging for more action to prevent future violations of Russia in the Ukraine , the former Soviet republic , which has been independent for 23 years . </seg>
<seg id="23">&quot; we will soon reach a point at which there is no return &apos; , Poroshenko warned . </seg>

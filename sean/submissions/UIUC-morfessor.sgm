<seg id="89">It was the spring of regrets was of their own, and unnecessary, cruel words because of their fear that the result, which was reflected in the eyes of this moment, when Ai castle decided to stand against him.</seg>
<seg id="90">I think I did that he be found?</seg>
<seg id="91">He had never told them of the spring to life in the north of the island, where he had grown of the spring, but was sure that it was essentially the same as life here.</seg>
<seg id="92">The same huge, to a sea wave that went against them.</seg>
<seg id="93">The same confused men, although the worst support after they still pale and the devil more than smugglers and dissolved by their grandparents, wander from pub to pub, ready to every woman who would dare to ring up or violence against them.</seg>

<seg id="98">Ai castle Solomon in body language urged him to leave.</seg>
<seg id="99">He pulled himself up on the patio chair as an old man.</seg>
<seg id="100">The castle also felt exhausted, but the depth of the sorrow of the spring has surprised him.</seg>
<seg id="101">This was not the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">They barely knew each other.</seg>
<seg id="103">The castle was his spending - just as he watched spring travel partner of the expenditure ceiling again from the window, the man who was in the cause of heavy lives.</seg>
<seg id="104">Ami leaving some garden, he thought.</seg>
